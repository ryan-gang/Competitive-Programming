    """Keeping in mind the O(1) space constraint, we also could've simply sorted the array.
    And found consecutive dissimilar items.
    In our solution we use the XOR logic gate.
    Because a ^ a is 0. So all the double number of elements will be reduced to 0.
    And finally 0 ^ ANSWER will give our required answer.
    Which is why we start with out = 0. Because later on we gonna see the same element (0)
    which will again give us 0, not changing our out.
