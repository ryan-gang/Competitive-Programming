    """
    Kadane's algorithm. Proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.

    Let's go through the array and accumulate the current prefix sum in some
    variable s. If at some point s is negative, we just assign s = 0. It is
    argued that the maximum of all the values that the variable s is assigned to
    during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.

    Proof:

    Consider the first index when the sum of s becomes negative. This means that
    starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial
    sum â€” so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a
    negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum
    of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.

    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are
    actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin
    immediately after the places when s<0 happened.

    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment [l, r], and l is not in such a
    "critical" position (i.e. l > p+1, where p is the last such position, in
    which s<0). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in
    l-1, it turns out that the sum of a[p+1 ... l-1] is non-negative. This means
    that by moving l to position p+1, we will increase the answer or, in extreme
    cases, we will not change it.

    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can
    limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions
    in which s<0 appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.
